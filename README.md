## Why?
### The Problem
Even senior developers struggle with large, unfamiliar, interconnected codebases and their dependencies. For AI, this is even a bigger problem because without enough context, AI can't help, and will hallucinate but with too much, it will exceed its capability (context window limits).

### Solution
This project develops tools for targeted, on-demand data extraction from diverse raw code repositories. It aims to provide AI clients (LLMs) with concise, query-relevant context/data to enhance understanding of unfamiliar or multiple codebases. This effectively manages token limits problem while complementing other existing AI tools.

## ‚ú® Features

* üòé **Latest Documentation on ANY GitHub Project**: Grant your AI assistant seamless access to the GitHub project's documentation and code. The built-in retrieval tools help the AI gets tree directory and specific file content without exceeding Context Window Limit!

* üß† **No More Hallucinations**: With Github Second Brain, your AI assistant can provide accurate and relevant answers to your questions.

* ‚úÖ **Open, Free, and Private**: Github Second Brain is open-source and completely free to use. It doesn't collect personal information or store queries. You can even self-host it!

* Extracting and analyzing data from GitHub repositories.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.

## üöÄ Installation

### Usage with Claude Desktop
  1. In Claude Desktop, go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config
  2. Replace the configuration with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-second-brain": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "ghcr.io/baonguyen09/github-second-brain-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with Cursor
Update your Cursor configuration file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-second-brain": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "ghcr.io/baonguyen09/github-second-brain-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
  ```

## ‚öô How It Works
Github Second Brain connects your AI assistant to GitHub repositories using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI tools request additional information from external sources.
What happens when you use Github Second Brain:
1. **You provide a [docker image](ghcr.io/baonguyen09/github-second-brain-mcp)** to your AI assistant that is used to build a local MCP server, exposing tools for fetching issue context, file content, directory tree, etc.
2. **Prompt the AI assistant** on documentation/code-related questions.
3. **Your AI sends requests** to the locally built MCP server to use its tools (with your approval).
4. **Local server executes the AI's request** and returns the requested data.
5. **Your AI receives the information** and generates a more accurate, grounded response without hallucinations.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
We are continuously working to improve GitHub Second Brain. Here are some of our planned features:

- [x] ~~Add a mcp tool to retrieve specific file content and tree directory~~
- [ ] Add a mcp tool to trieve ~~github issues~~ + pull request
- [ ] Change the current gitingest processing to async

For a more detailed view of our upcoming features and to suggest new ones, please see the open issues and our project board.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
Github Second Brain provides AI assistants with several valuable tools to help them access, understand, and query GitHub repositories.

### `get_processed_repo` (deprecated soon)

- This tool gives AI the entire codebase ingested into one prompt-friendly text file. It works by ingesting the entire codebase with gitingest library and serving it directly. This gives the AI a good comprehensive look of what the project is about. However, this tool isn't recommended and will soon be disabled because it can easily overflow AI with data, exceeding its Context Window Limit.

- **When it's useful:** For small repos, and to ask any types of questions: overview of the repo, how to contribute, etc.

### `get_tree_directory`

- This tool gives AI the full tree directory of the codebase in plaintext with indentation. Instead of loading all the documentation (which could be very large), it can use this to understand the overview of the repo, and then use other tools to retrieve relevant parts only.

- **When it's useful:** For questions about the structure of the repositories.

### `get_file_content`

- This tool returns full content of any files visible in the tree directory in plaintext.

- **When it's useful:** For specific questions about particular features, functions, concepts within a project, or any technical details not coverted in the documentation.

### `get_issue_context`

- This tool returns detailed context of any github issues including title, body, metadata, and all the comments within that issue.

- **When it's useful:** For questions related to a github issue and the context around it.
